# Chemorization by Team Espoir

## Your portable chemistry assistant

### Product Vision:
FOR visually impaired Chemistry students WHO need assistance summarizing and understanding chemistry content.
THE Chemorization App is a chemistry-focused mobile app
THAT uses AI to summarize spoken or written content, explain chemical concepts, provide periodic table references, and translate text to braille.
UNLIKE general summarization tools like QuillBot that lack specialized scientific context, and accessibility features
OUR PRODUCT tailors summaries for chemistry students and offers Braille-compatible printouts for enhanced accessibility.
